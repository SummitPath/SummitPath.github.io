##  Your Alternative Home Purchase Plan

Rent-to-Own helps individuals with difficulties in qualifying for a traditional mortgage, including insufficient savings, bruised credit history, or even a first time home buyer.  We buy the property of your choice for you now and rent it to you. At the same time, we help you recover your credit and build up an option credit to qualify for your own mortgage.  At the end of the program, you have the option to buy your own house at a pre-determined price and the option credit built up will be converted to your down payment towards the purchase.
